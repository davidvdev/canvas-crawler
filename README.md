# Canvas Crawler
A simple experiment in creating a top down perspective game using html canvas and javascript.

In the spirit of keeping this project as lightweight as possible, no frameworks have been introduced, and running the crawler is as simple as downloading the files and running the `index.html` file in your browser.
